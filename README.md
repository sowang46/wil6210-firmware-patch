# Wil6210 Firmware Patch
Note: this repo is originally forked from [NEXMON for Arc](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon-arc) but I lost the link to the original repo :-(  


The prerequisite and building process of wil6210 firmware should be the same with nexmon-arc.

# Nexmon for ARC
<img src="logos/talon.png" align="right" width=20% height=20%/>
This is the nexmon C-based firmware patching framework adapted for the ARC architecture, that enables you to write your own firmware patches for ARC based WiFi chips such as the QCA9500.

## Getting Started
The following explained how to use nexmon-arc and compile our hello world application for the wil6210 firmware v4.1.0.55, which prints a debug output that is readable from the device driver. The following instructions have been tested with Ubuntu 16.04.03.

### Setting up the environment (needs to be done only once)
* Installing dependencies (mostly for the ARC toolchain):

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install texinfo byacc flex libncurses5-dev zlib1g-dev libexpat1-dev texlive build-essential git wget bison gawk libgmp3-dev
  ```

* Run `make` in the root directory, this will download the original firmware and compile the ARC toolchain.

### Patch the firmware
* Setup the build environment for Nexmon:

  ```bash
  source setup_env.sh
  ```

* Go to the hello world example in the patches directory and execute `make`. This will build a patched firmware which prints a string at the initialization time of the fw and uc code. 

  ```bash
  cd patches/wil6210/4-1-0_55/hello_world
  make
  ```
* Copy the resulting `wil6210.fw` to your device (the default place in the filesystem is `/lib/firmware/wil6210.fw`)
* Restart the interface (executed on the device):

  ```bash
  ifconfig wlan2 down && ifconfig wlan2 up
  ```
* You should be able to get the following results by reading the `console_fw` and `console_uc` files in the debugfs:

  ```bash
  root@TALON1:~# cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy2/wil6210/console_dump_fw 
  FW: INITIALIZED
  root@TALON1:~# cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy2/wil6210/console_dump_uc 
  UC: INITIALIZED
  ```

  The `console_fw` and `console_uc` debugfs interfaces are custom extensions of the wil6210 driver that allow to read the output buffer from the firmware. This function is integrated in our [lede-ad7200](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/lede-ad7200) image for TP-Link Talon AD7200 devices and provided by [this](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/lede-ad7200/blob/release/overlay/seemoo/mac80211/patches/0002-adding-support-to-read-console-output.patch) patch. 

## Access the received signal strength of sector sweep frames

The following explained how to use nexmon-arc to gain access to the signal strength of received sector sweep frames in wil6210 firmware v4.1.0.55, and v5.2.0.18 and make it readable from our extended wil6210 device driver. The following instructions have been tested with Ubuntu 16.04.03.

* Choose the firmware you aim to work with either v4.1.0.55 or v5.2.0.18 are supported. 
* Go to the sweep_info example in the patches directory and execute `make`. This will build a patched firmware which keeps information on received sweep frames in a buffer in the uc code.

  ```bash
  cd patches/wil6210/4-1-0_55/sweep_info
  make
  ```
* Copy the resulting `wil6210.fw` to your device (the default place in the filesystem is `/lib/firmware/wil6210.fw`)
* Restart the interface (executed on the device):

  ```bash
  ifconfig wlan2 down && ifconfig wlan2 up
  ```
* You should be able to see a table of results by reading the `sweep_dump` files in the debugfs:

  ```bash
  root@TALON1:~# cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy2/wil6210/sweep_dump
  ```

  The `sweep_dump` debugfs interface is a custom extension for the wil6210 driver that allow to read the signal strength of received sector sweep frames from the firmware. This function is integrated in our [lede-ad7200](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/lede-ad7200) image for TP-Link Talon AD7200 devices. 
  Please check the version of the wil6210 firmware that is running in your LEDE system. Running a new firmware with an old driver might cause errors. You should keep the same version or update both the extended device driver and the patched firmware to the most recent release.

### Write your own patch
  To write your own patches, check the example files in *patches/wil6210/4-1-0_55/hello_world/src* and consider the original [Nexmon](https://nexmon.org) project for further documentation on the patching process.

## DISCLAIMER

## Statistics
Nexmon is mainly intended as a research project that we share with the community so that others can benefit from our tools.
We want to collect statistics to figure out how often Nexmon is used in general and which platform and firmware version is the most popular.
We also intent to share our findings in the future. For further information please check the original [Nexmon](https://nexmon.org) project page.

### What kind of statistics do you collect?

Every time you run a Nexmon firmware build, we collect the following information:
* A unique identifier based on a random number (e.g., 5O31UY9Z5IEX3O9KL680V5IHNASIE1SB)
* The name, release, machine and processor of your build system (`uname -srmp`, e.g., `Linux 4.2.0-42-generic x86_64 x86_64`)
* Git internal path to the built project (e.g., `patches/wil6210/4-1-0_55/hello_world/`)
* Git version (e.g., `2.2.1-55-g3684a80c-dirty`)
* Git repository URL (e.g., `git@github.com:seemoo-lab/nexmon-arc.git`)

### How do I disable the collection of statistics?

If you have privacy concerns, we also offer to opt-out of the statistic collections. To this end, you simply have to create a `DISABLE_STATISTICS` file in your Nexmon root directory.
